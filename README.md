# Useful MWEs

This is a collection of handy Minimal Working Examples (MWE). Each example is a component of some solution I've 
found useful in various engineering tasks or as a teaching tool.

I will update the repo as I find examples that fit. My criteria for adding to it (so far) are:

- An approach I've found useful on a repeated basis and required that I search existing code or study documentation to implement it again
- Examples I've found useful when leading a course or mentoring (primarily in oil & gas engineering & analytics)

I'm always interested in learning more! If you have suggestions, ideas, or if I can help any way, please 
reach out. The best way for now is <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/samshoun>LinkedIn</a>.
